ABOUT
DocuPsych: An Electronic Health Recording System for small Out Patient Mental Health practices. 
Why: As a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, all public and private healthcare providers and other eligible professionals (EP) were required to adopt and demonstrate “meaningful use” of electronic medical records (EMR) by January 1, 2014. 
For many small practice providers, the exorbitant cost of may EMR systems can be crippling. DocuPsych is a low-cost system which allows providers maintain compliance and focus on the care and needs of the mental health patients.
