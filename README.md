- Project 3 Proposal
DocuPsych: An Electronic Health Recording System for small Out Patient Mental Health practices. 
Why: As a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, all public and private healthcare providers and other eligible professionals (EP) were required to adopt and demonstrate “meaningful use” of electronic medical records (EMR) by January 1, 2014.
